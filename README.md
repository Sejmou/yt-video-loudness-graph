# YouTube Video Loudness Graph

These are my attempts to create a "loudness graph" from a YouTube video (as explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/48031793/13727176)). Not really working atm lol

## Development

### Setup

```
npm install
```

### Build

```
npm run build
```

### While developing

Make use of automated dev-build updates on every change in the source code by running

```
npm run watch
```

or hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> (if using VS code)

Unfortunately, there is no easy auto-hot-reload option for Chrome extensions. However, the next best thing I could find is the [Extensions Reloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid?hl=de) Chrome Extension. With this extension you can reload all unpacked extensions by clicking the extension icon or via a keyboard shortcut (default: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>).
